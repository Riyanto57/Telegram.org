<h3><a class="anchor" name="general-questions" href="faq.html#general-questions"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>General Questions</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-is-telegram-what-do-i-do-here" href="faq.html#q-what-is-telegram-what-do-i-do-here"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What is Telegram? What do I do here?</h4>
<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super fast, simple and free. You can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time</strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any of your phones, tablets or computers.</p>
<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <strong>files</strong> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200</strong> people. You can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <a href="faq.html#usernames-and-telegram-me"><strong>usernames</strong></a>. As a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-who-is-telegram-for" href="faq.html#q-who-is-telegram-for"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Who is Telegram for?</h4>
<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging. Business users and small teams may like the large groups, <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org">desktop apps</a> and <a href="blog/shared-files.html">file sharing</a> options. Since Telegram groups can have up to 200 members, we support <a href="blog/replies-mentions-hashtags.html">replies, mentions and hashtags</a> that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient.</p>
<p>In case you&#39;re more into pictures, Telegram has animated <a href="blog/android-gif.html">gif search</a>, a state of the art <a href="blog/photo-editor-and-passcodes.html">photo editor</a> and an <a href="blog/stickers.html">open sticker platform</a>.</p>
<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our <a href="blog/privacy-revolution.html">advanced settings</a> and rather revolutionary <a href="privacy.html">policy</a>. And if you want secrecy, try our device-specific <a href="faq.html#secret-chats">Secret Chats</a> with self-destructing messages, photos and videos — and lock your app with an additional <a href="blog/photo-editor-and-passcodes.html">passcode</a>.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-is-telegram-different-from-whatsapp" href="faq.html#q-how-is-telegram-different-from-whatsapp"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?</h4>
<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is cloud-based and heavily encrypted. As a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc) of up to 1,5 GB. Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is also faster and way more <a href="faq.html#security">secure</a>. On top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-who-are-the-people-behind-telegram" href="faq.html#q-who-are-the-people-behind-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?</h4>
<p>Telegram is supported by Pavel and Nikolai Durov. Pavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically, while Nikolai&#39;s input is technological. To make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers. As a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.</p>
<p>While the Durov brothers were born in Russia, as were some of the key developers, Telegram is not connected to Russia – legally or physically. Telegram&#39;s HQ is in Berlin.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-will-you-have-ads-or-sell-my-data-or-steal-my-wife-and-enslave" href="faq.html#q-will-you-have-ads-or-sell-my-data-or-steal-my-wife-and-enslave"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my wife and enslave my children?</h4>
<p>No.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this" href="faq.html#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?</h4>
<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.</p>
<p>Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation through his Digital Fortress fund, so we have quite enough money for the time being. If Telegram runs out, we&#39;ll invite our users to donate and add nonessential paid options to break even. But making profits will never be a goal for Telegram. </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-are-your-thoughts-on-internet-privacy" href="faq.html#q-what-are-your-thoughts-on-internet-privacy"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?</h4>
<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years. Their marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your online status, your public posts or your profile pictures from the people around you. Adding these superficial tools allows companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.</p>
<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of internet privacy should be instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.</li>
<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities. Telegram is a <a href="faq.html#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this">non-commercial project</a> with an aim to create a truly free messenger, <a href="privacy.html">without the usual caveats</a>. This means that instead of diverting attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-old-is-telegram" href="faq.html#q-how-old-is-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How old is Telegram?</h4>
<p>Telegram for iPhone was launched on August 14, 2013. The alpha version of Telegram for Android was officially launched on October 20, 2013. More and more <a href="apps.html">Telegram clients</a> appear, built by independent developers using Telegram&#39;s <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api">open platform</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-which-devices-are-supported" href="faq.html#q-which-devices-are-supported"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Which devices are supported?</h4>
<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets and even computers. We have apps for <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/ios">iOS</a> (6 and above), <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/android">Android</a> (2.2 and up) and <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/wp">Windows Phone</a>. You can also use Telegram&#39;s <a href="https://web.telegram.org">web version</a> or install one of our <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org">desktop apps</a> for Windows, OSX and Linux.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time</strong>. Just use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api">API</a> is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.  </p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="telegram-basics" href="faq.html#telegram-basics"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Telegram Basics</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-who-can-i-write-to" href="faq.html#q-who-can-i-write-to"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Who can I write to?</h4>
<p>You can write to people, who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram.</p>
<p>You can also select a public <a href="faq.html#usernames-and-telegram-me">username</a> for your Telegram account. Other people will be able to search and find you by that username — and send messages to you even if they don&#39;t know your number. You can learn more about usernames <a href="faq.html#usernames-and-telegram-me">here</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-know-who-in-my-contacts-has-telegram" href="faq.html#q-how-do-i-know-who-in-my-contacts-has-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I know, who in my contacts has Telegram?</h4>
<p>Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts. They also have pictures.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-invite-my-friends" href="faq.html#q-how-do-i-invite-my-friends"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I invite my friends?</h4>
<p><em>iPhone:</em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages. They will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage). Naturally, you have other options to bring your friends here. Try sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it. The link: <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/"><strong><a href="https://telegram.org/dl/">https://telegram.org/dl/</a></strong></a></p>
<p><em>Android:</em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chats list) — Invite Friends. Then choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<br><em>Windows Phone:</em> Go to Contacts — Invite Friends. Then choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can give your friends a <a href="faq.html#q-how-does-telegram-me-work">telegram.me link</a> with your username, so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don&#39;t have your phone number.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-do-the-green-checks-mean" href="faq.html#q-what-do-the-green-checks-mean"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What do the green checks mean?</h4>
<p><em>One check</em> — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified, if he allows notifications.<br><em>Two checks</em> — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).</p>
<p>We don‘t have a ’delivered to device&#39; status for messages, because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want. So which particular one would that check mean?</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-create-a-group" href="faq.html#q-how-do-i-create-a-group"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I create a group?</h4>
<p><em>iPhone:</em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top right corner in Chats). Then ‘New Group’.<br><em>Android:</em> Tap the circular pencil icon in the chats list. Then ‘New Group’.<br><em>Windows Phone:</em> Tap the “+” button on the bottom bar. Then ‘New Group’.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-39s-a-broadcast" href="faq.html#q-what-39s-a-broadcast"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What&#39;s a broadcast?</h4>
<p>Broadcasts allow you to send the same message to up to 100 of your contacts at once. Unlike in a group, the recipients won&#39;t know about each other and will receive the broadcast as an ordinary message from you. Once a broadcast list has been created, it can be re-used to message the same set of contacts again.</p>
<p>To create a broadcast list:<br><em>iPhone:</em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top-right corner in Chats). Then ‘New Broadcast’.<br><em>Android:</em> Tap the circular pencil icon in the chats list. Then ‘New Broadcast’.<br><em>Windows Phone:</em> Tap the “+” button on the bottom bar. Then ‘New Broadcast’.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-can-i-hide-my-last-seen-time" href="faq.html#q-can-i-hide-my-last-seen-time"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?</h4>
<p>You can choose who sees this info in <a href="blog/privacy-revolution.html">Privacy and Security</a> settings (introduced in Telegram for Android 2.0, and iOS version 2.7.2).</p>
<p>Remember that you won‘t see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don’t share your own. You will, however, see an approximate last seen value. This keeps stalkers away, but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram. There are four possible approximate values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last seen recently</strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days</li>
<li><strong>Last seen within a week</strong> — between 2-3 and 7 days</li>
<li><strong>Last seen within a month</strong> — between 6-7 days and a month</li>
<li><strong>Last seen long time ago</strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-can-i-make-calls-or-video-calls-via-telegram" href="faq.html#q-can-i-make-calls-or-video-calls-via-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Can I make calls or video calls via Telegram?</h4>
<p>We specialize in sending messages, large media and files — and we do this better than anyone out there.</p>
<p>We may enable voice calls if we see significant demand in the future. The technology necessary for encrypted calls has indeed been created in our R&amp;D dungeons.</p>
<p>But for now we see many things that could still be revolutionized in messaging. And messaging is obviously trending at the moment, so our focus remains in that area for now.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-can-i-use-emoticons-in-telegram-on-my-iphone" href="faq.html#q-how-can-i-use-emoticons-in-telegram-on-my-iphone"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How can I use emoticons in Telegram on my iPhone?</h4>
<p>We support emoji emoticons. Simply enable the emoji keyboard in your iOS device‘s Settings (General – Keyboards – Add New Keyboard… – Emoji). Then switch to that keyboard whenever you’re out of words.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="usernames-and-telegram-me" href="faq.html#usernames-and-telegram-me"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Usernames and telegram.me</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-are-usernames-how-do-i-get-one" href="faq.html#q-what-are-usernames-how-do-i-get-one"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What are usernames? How do I get one?</h4>
<p>You can set up a <strong>public</strong> username on Telegram. It then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search under ‘global results’. Please note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don&#39;t know your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.</p>
<p>Usernames and search by username are supported in most of the official <a href="apps.html">apps</a> — you can set up a username in Settings.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-does-telegram-me-work" href="faq.html#q-how-does-telegram-me-work"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How does telegram.me work?</h4>
<p>Once you&#39;ve set up a username, you can give people a <a href="https://telegram.me/YourUsernameHere">telegram.me/YourUsernameHere</a> link. Opening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you. You can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.</p>
<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.</p>

<p>You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores. Usernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g. Telegram and TeleGram is the same user). The username must be at least 5 characters long.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-do-i-need-a-username" href="faq.html#q-do-i-need-a-username"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Do I need a username?</h4>
<p>You don‘t have to get one. Remember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don’t have your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.</p>

<p>No. Neither party will see another‘s phone number. This is similar to the case when you message a person who you’ve met in a Telegram group.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this: just as in case of all Telegram messages, if <strong>you</strong> have somebody‘s number saved as a contact and you send them a message, your number also becomes visible to them. Just like with SMS. This happens regardless of how you open the conversation with that person — via the contacts menu, global search by username, telegram.me link, or from a group’s members page.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got you covered. Telegram’s special <a href="index.html#secret-chats">secret chats</a> use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding.

<p>We support two layers of secure encryption. <a href="https://core.telegram.org/mtproto">Server-client encryption</a> is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end">client-client encryption</a>. All data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.</p>
<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, RSA 2048 encryption and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. You can find more info in the <a href="http://core.telegram.org/techfaq">Advanced FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication. This means that all data (including media and files), that you send and receive via Telegram, cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your ISP, network administrator or other third parties.</p>
<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your phone. Or from your IT-department if they access your computer at work. Or from any other people that get physical or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser">root</a> access to your phones or computers running Telegram.</p>
<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only <a href="faq.html#secret-chats">Secret Chats</a> in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a <a href="faq.html#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work">self-destruct timer</a>. And don&#39;t root or jailbreak your phone.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-why-can-jailbroken-and-rooted-devices-be-dangerous" href="faq.html#q-why-can-jailbroken-and-rooted-devices-be-dangerous"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?</h4>
<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser">root access</a>.</p>
<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal">internal storage</a>. Once an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile. No application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-are-secret-chats-different" href="faq.html#q-how-are-secret-chats-different"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How are secret chats different?</h4>
<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella. All messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram. Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats. And when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.</p>
<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to <a href="faq.html#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work">self-destruct</a> in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient. The message will then disappear from both your and your friend&#39;s devices.</p>
<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud. This means, you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin. </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-start-a-secret-chat" href="faq.html#q-how-do-i-start-a-secret-chat"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I start a secret chat?</h4>
<p><em>iOS:</em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top-right corner in Messages). Then ‘New secret chat’.<br><em>Android:</em> Swipe right to open menu, then ‘New secret chat’.<br><em>WP:</em> Tap + in the chats list, then ‘New secret chat’.</p>
<p>Remember that secret chats are device-specific. If you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device. If you log out, you will lose all your secret chats. You can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work" href="faq.html#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?</h4>
<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for Secret Сhats only. To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android, chat info page on WP), then Set Self-Destruct Timer to a desired time limit. The timer is applied to a message the moment it is displayed on the recipient&#39;s screen (two green checks). As soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both</strong> devices and leaves no trace.</p>
<p>Photos sent with short self-destruct timers (&lt; 1 minute) can only be viewed while you&#39;re holding your finger on them — and we will notify both parties whenever a screenshot is taken.</p>
<p>Please note that the timer only applies to messages that are sent <strong>after</strong> the timer was set. It has no effect on earlier messages.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-whats-this-encryption-key-39-thing" href="faq.html#q-whats-this-encryption-key-39-thing"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What‘s this ’Encryption Key&#39; thing?</h4>
<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>. After the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat. You can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure and no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attack</a> can possibly succeed.</p>
<p>Always compare pictures using a channel that is known to be secure — it&#39;s safest if you do this in person, when meeting offline in the real world out there.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-secret" href="faq.html#q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-secret"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Why not just make all chats ‘secret’?</h4>
<p>While all Telegram messages are always securely encrypted, messages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client</strong> encryption, while cloud chats use <strong>client-server/server-client</strong> encryption and are stored securely encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more <a href="privacy.html#2-storing-data">here</a>). This enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices, you can also easily find them using server search — which is very useful at times.</p>
<p>The idea behind Telegram is to bring something more secure to the masses, who understand nothing about security and want none of it. Being merely secure is not enough to achieve this — you also need to be fast, powerful and user friendly. This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries.</p>

<p>Telegram is officially available in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, Arabic and Portuguese on all platforms.</p>
<p>We are gradually expanding the list of official languages built into the apps, but there are other options as well. Telegram apps support <strong>external language packs</strong>. The .xml files for the Android app and Localizable.strings files for iOS can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.transifex.com/organization/telegram/">this Transifex page</a>. Of course, you can also change the language files in any way you like and thus create your own personal Telegram localization.</p>
<p>To apply an external language pack, send (or receive) the file via Telegram (attached as ‘file’), download it, then tap on it to see the menu (on Android: tap on … in the upper right corner of the doc bubble) then select ‘Apply localization file’. You will see a language selection menu with the language from the file as one of the options. Yes, this <em>is</em> damn tricky, we&#39;ll simplify the process in the next versions.</p>

Note that Google notifications (GCM) just won‘t work properly on some Android devices. The Telegram notification service is reliable, but requires additional battery resources. It doesn’t and shouldn&#39;t take much though, so please report all drastic battery-draining cases immediately.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Telegram Settings — Notifications and Sounds, make sure that notifications are ON.</li>
<li>Check, whether contact or group is <em>muted</em>.</li>
<li>If the Telegram <em>Notifications Service</em> is disabled, make sure <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms">Google Play Services</a> are installed on your phone.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you know your friends have Telegram, but you can&#39;t see them — or they appear as numbers instead of names.</p>
<p><em>iPhone:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Force quit the app (double tap home button, then swipe up on Telegram), then relaunch and check if it helped.</li>
<li>If that doesn&#39;t help, temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).</li>
<li>If that doesn’t work, re-login: Settings – Edit – Log Out. Remember that logging out kills all your Secret Chats. Then log in again.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Android:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you are using the latest version of the app.</li>
<li>Relaunch the app (by terminating it from processes list and launching again).</li>
<li>Temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).</li>
<li>If that didn&#39;t help, try to re-login.</li>

<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on. This means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.</p>
<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device. If you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.</p>

<p>Facebook seems to have taken down our page for no apparent reason. We&#39;re trying to figure out what happened and how to take it back. (This was the address, in case you were curious: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tlgrm"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/tlgrm">https://www.facebook.com/tlgrm</a></a>). So for now, if anyone on Facebook is telling you they&#39;re us, they are not.</p>
